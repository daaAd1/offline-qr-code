# Offline QR Code Generator

<img height="200" width="200" src="assets/qrbig-optimized.svg">

This is a (Firefox) Web Extension, which makes it possible to generate a QR code from any website.

In contrast to many other add-ons, which use Google Web APIs for that, this add-on works completely offline.
Effectively, the add-on [prevents any web connection](src/manifest.json#L25) for itself, so it does never contact the web. Thanks to the linked `manifest.json` you can also easily verify, that this claim is true. It works offline! Always.

It is inspired by [the old Offline QR code generator add-on](https://github.com/catholicon/OfflineQR) for Firefox 56 and lower. This extension only works with Firefox Quantum (Firefox 57) and higher.
