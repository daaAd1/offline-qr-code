In contrast to many other add-ons, which use Google Web APIs for generating QR codes, this add-on works completely offline. <b>This QR code generator puts your privacy first!</b>
Effectively, the add-on <a href="https://github.com/rugk/offline-qr-code/blob/master/src/manifest.json#L33">prevents any web connection</a> for itself, so it cannot even technically contact the web. Thanks to the linked <code>manifest.json</code> you can also easily verify, that this claim is true. It works offline! Always.

<b>So easy, you can use it with one click!</b>

It has a radically <b>simple, yet powerful</b> user interface, allowing you to tweak many details in the settings, but being lightweight when you use it. A powerful usability improvement is the feature to <b>just resize the QR code</b> with your mouse by dragging and dropping. Being <b>lightweight</b> and thus having a small size it is also fast and easy to install – even on mobile connections.

It is inspired by <a href="https://github.com/catholicon/OfflineQR">the old Offline QR code generator add-on</a> for Firefox 56 and lower.

<b>Generate a variety of QR codes!</b>

Generate <b>colored</b> QR codes, <b>save</b> QR codes or just simple black/white ones to send a tab or other text from your desktop to your mobile! You have the choice!
Your QR code will only be <b>one click away</b> and you can an instantly start typing to change the QR code text! Your QR code will be generated automatically.
